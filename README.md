# Managing Your Biological Data with Python 3

Origin Fork from https://github.com/re4lfl0w/ipython/tree/master/books/Managing_Your_Biological_Data_with_Python

I trans the code to Python 3

## Why I chose this book

- Bio-based books and study materials

## The thought I heard while organizing this book

- Learning Basic Python Grammar
- It was an opportunity to look at how bio is using Python, but I need domain knowledge like pdb, protein structure.
- Because I needed a little knowledge of biotechnology, I had been asking for two hours of study, but I was not interested in digging more. And when I learn too many subjects, I have skimmed the surface because I can neglect what I really have to do.
My topic is Function, Debugging, Good Program, so it has a lot of IT characteristics.
